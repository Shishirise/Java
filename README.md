# Types of Variables in Java
## 1. Local Variables
```java
Declared inside a method/functions.
Only accessible within that method.
Must be initialized before use.


public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10; // local variable
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
```
## 2.Instance Variables
```java
Declared inside a class but outside methods.
Each object gets its own copy.
```
